# obsidian-calendar-notify

Program to read files generated by [Obsidian Full Calendar](https://davish.github.io/obsidian-full-calendar/) and outputs the remaining events today.

## Usage

`obsidian-calendar-notify <path(s) to directory containing calendar notes>`

Currently only supports the mode of Obsidian Full Calendar that stores each event in its own note.

## Example

The following day in Obsidian Full Calendar produces this output using `obsidian-calendar-summary`:

I like to add `obsidian-calendar-summary` to the end of my `.bashrc` along with [todo week all](https://github.com/Jachdich/todo-rs) to show my events today and my deadlines this week at the top of each terminal.
